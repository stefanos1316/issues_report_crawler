# Crawler for Issues Report

This is the second task for my Postdoctoral interview where I am supposed to
develop a crawler to parse Apache Camel reports from Jira.
And I am very sure that Guoliang is more interested in this task rather than
the first one.
Therefore, I will try to offer a good quality of code.
But note that this tool will be in BASH :P

On second a thought, I think it might be easier in JavaScrit (NodeJS)
because it offers many modules to parse xml or even convert it to JSON.
