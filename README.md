# Crawler for Issues Report

This is the second task for my Postdoctoral interview where I am supposed to
develop a crawler to parse Apache Camel reports from Jira.
And I am very sure that Guoliang is more interested in this task rather than
the first, I will try to offer a good quality of code.
But note that this tool will be in BASH :P
