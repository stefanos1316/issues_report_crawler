Within the Swagger Doc the path for ClassA renders as expected: /test: get: responses: 200: schema: $ref: '#/definitions/ClassA' However ClassB gets a string parameter scheme /testSub: get: responses: 200: schema: type : 'string' format : 'com.ClassB' However I'd expect it to be: /testSub: get: responses: 200: schema: $ref: '#/definitions/ClassB' , Patch Available, Unknown, GitHub user bobpaulin opened a pull request: https://github.com/apache/camel/pull/1348 CAMEL-10597 - Allow addition of x-className to empty VendorExtensions You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running: $ git pull https://github.com/bobpaulin/camel CAMEL-10597 Alternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at: https://github.com/apache/camel/pull/1348.patch To close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch with (at least) the following in the commit message: This closes #1348 , PR included https://github.com/apache/camel/pull/1348, Thanks for the PR, Github user bobpaulin closed the pull request at: https://github.com/apache/camel/pull/1348, 2.17.x is affected too Claus Ibsen, Thanks its backported now
